# Blind-Stick
A Blind Stick in IoT refers to a smart, connected walking cane designed to assist visually impaired or blind individuals by integrating Internet of Things (IoT) technology. Unlike a traditional white cane, this smart stick uses various sensors, wireless communication, and sometimes AI to enhance mobility, safety, and independence for users.
