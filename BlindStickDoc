Abstract: Smart Blind Stick Using IoT
The Smart Blind Stick is an innovative assistive device designed to enhance the mobility and safety of visually impaired individuals. This project integrates IoT (Internet of Things) technologies to detect obstacles, notify the user, and ensure safer navigation in both indoor and outdoor environments.

Equipped with ultrasonic sensors, the stick can detect obstacles at various distances and alert the user through vibration motors or buzzers. In addition, the device can be enhanced with features such as GPS tracking and emergency message alerts to provide location tracking and send alerts to caretakers during emergencies. The compact and lightweight design ensures user comfort, while the real-time detection system helps reduce accidents and dependency on others.

By combining affordability, efficiency, and ease of use, the Smart Blind Stick serves as a practical solution to improve the quality of life for the visually challenged, enabling them to navigate with increased independence and confidence.

Literature survey:-
Several assistive devices have been developed to aid visually impaired individuals, ranging from traditional white canes to modern electronic aids. Research shows that ultrasonic sensors are effective for obstacle detection, but many systems lack directional alerts or are difficult to use. Some projects have implemented GPS and GSM modules for location tracking and emergency alerts, but they often face issues like high cost and power consumption.
Existing commercial products like SmartCane™ offer good features but are often expensive and not customizable. Therefore, there is a need for a low-cost, easy-to-use smart stick that combines obstacle detection, vibration feedback, and IoT-based emergency alerts to enhance user safety and independence.
Obstacle Detection Using Ultrasonic Sensors
Research has shown that ultrasonic sensors can effectively detect obstacles in a specific range. In a study by [Author Name, Year], a prototype was developed using ultrasonic sensors mounted on a cane, which alerted users via buzzers. However, the system lacked direction-based alerts and did not differentiate object types or heights.
GPS and GSM-Based Location Tracking
Several systems have integrated GPS modules to track the user's location and GSM modules to send emergency alerts. For instance, [Author Name, Year] proposed a blind navigation system that sends real-time location data to a caretaker via SMS. While effective, such systems often suffer from delays in GPS signal acquisition and high power consumption.
Wearable vs. Handheld Devices
Comparative studies between wearable devices and handheld sticks (like the smart cane) have indicated that most visually impaired users prefer handheld devices for comfort and familiarity. Wearables often require additional training and user adaptation.
IoT-Enabled Smart Canes
IoT integration enables real-time monitoring, data collection, and remote support. In [Author Name, Year], a smart cane was connected to a cloud platform for remote data access. Although promising, cloud-based systems require stable internet, which is a limitation in rural areas.
Existing Commercial Products
Commercial products like SmartCane™ (developed in India) have made significant progress in helping the visually impaired navigate safely. However, high costs and lack of customization remain barriers to widespread adoption.

Requirements:
